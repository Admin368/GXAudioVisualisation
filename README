I was fighting with it so longâ€¦ I lose my coding power (my coding power never exist).

TODO:
- Create GitWiki
- MAKE SCRIPT AS ADDON!

faaaaaaar future:
- make script as dynamic, change variables refreshing 3d_view
- cycles/internal material create (with fancy options \o/)
- more visualisation options! MORE MORE MORE, still far future.

Do you want me to help motivate me? Or you want to thank me for this piece of s***cript?
You can send some paypal donation to gethiox@gmail.com, or just send e-mail, that's great too.
